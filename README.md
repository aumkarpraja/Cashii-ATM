# Cashii ATM


Cashii is an ATM simulator that is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript with Bootstrap in the front-end and Java, Spark and mySQL in the backend. Cashii is responsive and adjusts the page based on the size of the web browser. User data is stored on a remote SQL database for security purposes. Cashii uses a RESTful API as its backend. Cashii was built using the Scrum methodology. The front-end was created by Alex Grigorev and the backend was created by Aumkar Prajapati and Sameer Mehta. Eric Flieth served as the tester and wrote unit tests for Cashii and tested the UI. Henry Vo and Rodrigo Goncales served as the client / project owner and Requirements Engineer respectfully. This project was led and managed by Sameer Mehta.
